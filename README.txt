CODE1.txt: Assembly language code for Program1
CODE2.txt: Assembly language code for Program2

OPCODES.txt: List of all opcodes used in assembly code and their binary representation
REGISTERS.txt: List of all registers

PASS1.c: C program to generate label table from the assembly code
PASS2.c: C program to generate binary machine code using assembly code and label table genearted using pass1.c

OUTPUT.c: C program to execute the binary machine code

SYMBOL TABLE1.txt, SYMBOL TABLE2.txt: Label file generated using pass1.c
FINAL1.txt, FINAL2.txt: Binary machine code generated using pass2.c


STEP1: Run PASS1.c
    This will generate the label table for the given assembly code.

STEP2: Run PASS1.c
    This will generate binary machine code for the given assembly code.

STEP3: Run OUTPUT.c
    This will execute the binary machine code generated in STEP2.

NOTE: For the OUTPUT.c file input is to be given via terminal and the outputs are written in OUTPUT1.txt and OUTPUT2.txt
Arithematic operations are performed by bitwise functions namely add,subtract,multiply.
